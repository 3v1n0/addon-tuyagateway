# Home Assistant Add-on: TuyaGateway

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the add-on installed on your system:

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Supervisor** -> **Add-on Store**.
2. Click on the three dots in the upper left, then **Repositories**, and add this repository: https://github.com/sjthespian/addon-tuyagateway
3. Find the "TuyaGateway" add-on and click it.
4. Click on the "INSTALL" button.

## How to use

1. No configuration is necessary if you are running MQTT on your Home Assistant server. If not, in the TuyaGateway add-on configuration, perform the following:
    - Add your MQTT username and password if any.
    - Update MQTT host IP address and port if you aren't running MQTT on your Home Assistant server.
2. Click the **Start** button to start the add-on.
3. Check the Log tab to insure the add-on started and is communicating to your MQTT broker.

## Configuration

Optional add-on configuration if no MQTT server running on HA:

```yaml
mqttuser: ""
mqttpass: ""
mqtthost: 127.0.0.1
mqttport: 1883
```

#### Option `mqttuser`

Username for authenticating to the MQTT broker

#### Option `mqttpass`

Password for authenticating to the MQTT broker

#### Option `mqtthost`

IP or hostname of the MQTT broker. The default should work if your MQTT broker is running on your Home Assitant instance.

#### Option `mqttport`

Network port of the MQTT server. The default should work if your MQTT broker is running on the standard port.

For example:

```yaml
mqttuser: mqttuser
mqttpass: mqttpass
mqtthost: 127.0.0.1
mqttport: 1883
```
